### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Tribute Page for FCC.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to be moving forward and completing the project. I find coding in codepen a bit cumbersome will be looking to ways to move them to github.

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the Tribute Page for FCC.

**Thoughts:** Though the project is really simple, it took me more time to start building it than what I've thought. It's great to be able to put the pieces back together again. Slowly getting there.

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: As prep work, started the GIT challenge in FCC as a referesher on Git to allow me to track my work and progress via Github

**Thoughts:** Starting out is always the hard part of any self-project. Good thing I managed to plow through all the steps in the tutorial and seeing my Github activity become active feels like going back to the gym after the holidays.
