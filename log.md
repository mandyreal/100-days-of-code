# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: As prep work, started the GIT challenge in FCC as a referesher on Git to allow me to track my work and progress via Github

**Thoughts:** Starting out is always the hard part of any self-project. Good thing I managed to plow through all the steps in the tutorial and seeing my Github activity become active feels like going back to the gym after the holidays.
