### Day 26: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Re-started Flat Iron's iOS Bootcamp prep

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed doing the labs. As always, the best to learn coding in new language is to code. There's always that satisfying feeling in submitting a pull request. At this point, between iOS and frontend dev - I'm trying to weigh whether my time and effort is more worth spending in one than the other.

### Day 24: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC algo on Friendly Date Ranges

**Thoughts:** Took me longer than I expected. I had trouble using the Date.UTC function, because the month parameter starts at 0 for January. How tricky can that be?

**Link to work:** [FCC Friendly Date range] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/blob/gh-pages/algorithm%20scripting/dateRange.js)


### Day 23: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FCC algo on Friendly Date Ranges

**Thoughts:** Most of the time I try to push myself to push the challeng all in one day. If I'm not able to, it's still good to start something small and build on it daily.

**Link to work:** [FCC Friendly Date range] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/blob/gh-pages/algorithm%20scripting/dateRange.js)


### Day 22: February 7, 2017

### Day 19: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to work again on the TwitchTV viewer app for FCC.

**Thoughts:** Due to travels, skipped a few days. Now, trying hard to get back up to speed. Slow progress trying to figure out the structure of the API's returned data. Slow progress today.

### Day 18: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Minor fix on the app as it was crashing when ran on actual device. Today I learned that privacy settings required by the app need to updated in the Info.plist.

**Thoughts:** It's always good to test apps on the simulator and on actual device. Managed to figure out the root cause just by reading from the forums as this bit of info is not included in the tutorial. 

**Link to work:** [Pitch Perfect App from Udacity] (https://github.com/mandyreal/PitchPerfect.git)


### Day 17: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the iOS app which I've doing on the side. This is the first app for Udacity's Intro to iOS Development course.

### Day 16: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Twitch Viewer project on FCC. Added the Twitchtv API. Good thing no user registration is required. My next target is to parse the API's returned json into the HTML elements.

**Thoughts:** Slow progress but better than none.

### Day 15: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Twitch Viewer project on FCC

**Thoughts:** Played around Bootstrap tabs to implement the different views. I skipped a day yesterday because it was Friday! Good thing is now I'm on track again. 

**Link to work:** [FCC Intermediate frontend Project 4 - Twitch Viewers] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/tree/gh-pages/02/twitch)


### Day 14: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch Viewer project on FCC

**Thoughts:** I reviewed the user stories and started planning the app in my head. My goal is to code each line as much as possible without copying from my earlier projects. This would take time but I feel would be more effective in retaining the important basics.

### Day 12: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added code to dynamically display Wiki search results. All user stories satisfied.

**Thoughts:** One minor project done! I feel there's more styling required to make it appear more appealing. Maybe I can go back later to improve the styling. I'll keep moving for now.

### Day 10: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Everything Be Truth algorithm in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Good to be able to review Javascript Objects again. It's to be able to complete at least one challenge a day, it brings me closer to completeing the FCC frontend cert. And the daily commits on Github looks good!

**Link to work:** [FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting - Everything be True] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/blob/gh-pages/algorithm%20scripting/truthcheck.js)


### Day 9: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished BinaryAgent algorithm in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Chugging along the JS algorithm scripting in FCC.

**Link to work:** [FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting - BinaryAgent] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/blob/gh-pages/algorithm%20scripting/binaryagent.js)


### Day 8: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Switched back to doing algorithms for now.

**Thoughts:** To brush up on Javascript (reduce self-imposed pressure on progressing the intermediate app project), decided to doing the algo scripting for now. Some progress is better than no progress at all. Earlier today I revisited Codecademy and Code School courses on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It really needs to practice to retain everything I learned previously. After that, I plan to go back to doing the intermediate projects.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Wikipedia Viewer App for FCC

**Thoughts:** I struggled with starting the app. Based on experience, having a design mockup makes it easier to start coding the html structure and all. Need to review forms and input fields in HTML, more so the related Bootstrap classes. It's a slow start for this app. 

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer App for FCC] (https://mandyreal.github.io/freecodecamp/02/wiki/) [.Source code here] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/tree/gh-pages/02/wiki)


### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued until early morning to fix bugs. All worked fine until app was uploaded to Github pages. Due to mixed content, API call to OpenWeatherMap over http did not work. I searched for alternatives but eventually ended up using Dark Sky which offered https even for developer accounts. Continued adding the toggle button later today until the final app is meeting all user stories. 

**Thoughts:** It feels really good to finally have completed this project! Last time I struggled hard on how and where to start. The answer is to just start coding. If not for the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I would have immediately stopped in the middle of building the app. I encountered a few issues like mixed content in Github pages. Though I spent a lot of time resolving the issue, it was a good learning experience. So far Day 6 had been the longest time I spent on the challenge. Now I feel more prepared to tackle the next mini project.

)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing the Local Weather app. Browser location is now being displayed. API call to OpenWeatherMap is incorporated - temperature and appropriate icon are now being displayed. The only remaining feature is to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. And also, app works in Chrome but not Safari.

**Thoughts:** It's good to be able to incorporate API calls again. This involved reading API docs and sample codes. There was still a bit of struggle with basic HTML and CSS, so that's still another area to brush up on. It feels good that web app is slowly coming together.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App for FCC] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/tree/gh-pages/02/weather
)


### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Local Weather App, this is the 1st intermediate project for FCC. One of the main functions which is to get user's browser location is already in place. Next up would be API call to get weather details then build up the rest of the doc to display icon and temperature.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time reviewing HTML and Bootstrap. I felt more confident when I code the project from scratch as this ensures I understand what each bit of code does and how the parts come together as one. Need to brush up on CSS and Javascript too. It's a long way to go still. 

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App for FCC] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp/tree/gh-pages/02/weather
)


### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup local dev environment using Sublimetext and hosting pages in Github pages. I find it hard to read code in Codepen thus the move to Github.

**Thoughts:** It feels more at home coding in Sublimetext than Codepen. Managed to set up new repository in Github for FCC specific projects. 

**Link to work:** [My Freecodecamp projects repo in Github] (https://github.com/mandyreal/freecodecamp.git)


### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Tribute Page for FCC.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to be moving forward and completing the project. I find coding in codepen a bit cumbersome will be looking to ways to move them to github.

**Link to work:** [Basic Frontend Proect 1 : Build A Tribute Page] (http://codepen.io/mandyreal/pen/bgbLRa)

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the Tribute Page for FCC.

**Thoughts:** Though the project is really simple, it took me more time to start building it than what I've thought. It's great to be able to put the pieces back together again. Slowly getting there.

**Link to work:** [Basic Frontend Proect 1 : Build A Tribute Page] (http://codepen.io/mandyreal/pen/bgbLRa)


### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: As prep work, started the GIT challenge in FCC as a referesher on Git to allow me to track my work and progress via Github

**Thoughts:** Starting out is always the hard part of any self-project. Good thing I managed to plow through all the steps in the tutorial and seeing my Github activity become active feels like going back to the gym after the holidays.
